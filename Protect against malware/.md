恶意软件入侵的七个阶段：  
----------------
Reconnaissance: The malicious actor assesses the target and determines the attack strategy.  
Intrusion: The malicious actor gains access to the target system using the attack strategy developed in the reconnaissance phase.  
Exploitation: The malicious actor sinks their claws into the target system and achieves greater access.  
Privilege escalation: The malicious actor gains admin privileges to maximize their access to the target system.    
Lateral movement: The malicious actor begins leapfrogging from system to system in the target network.  
Command and control: The malicious actor achieves network access.  
Actions on objectives: The malicious actor begins stealing, destroying, or encrypting target data.
